**License URI**: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html

A [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com) plugin that helps you with creating
neat table of contents on the beginning of your .css file

![demo](http://i.imgur.com/RD053Tm.gif)

Add sections, subsections and sub-subsections to your .css file with ease. The plugin
keeps track of your cursor and selection when creating section markup.
You can add your desired subsections and sub-subsections after you've already add some in.
If you don't name your sections, it's done automatically.

## How to install

### Via Package Control
Open your command palette -> Package Control: Install Package -> CSS Table of Contents

### Manual

Go to your packages folder(Preferences -> Browse Packages)
```bash
# clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/dingo-d/CSS-Table-of-Contents 'CSS Table of Contents'
```
Or download the leatest [release](https://github.com/dingo-d/CSS-Table-of-Contents/releases)
and unzip it in a folder named `CSS Table of Contents`

## How to use it

You can right click on the contents of your .css file and add them from the menu
'CSS Table of Contents', from Tools > CSS Table of Contents submenu, or by using hotkeys

`ctrl+t, g` for section
`ctrl+t, g` for subsection
`ctrl+t, g` for subsubsection
`ctrl+t, t` for table of contents creation

## To do

This is the initial release, I have plans to add some more options like navigation through
the sections, subsections and sub-subsections. Changing the Table of contents title in the
settings. And what ever somebody suggests.

Please test it and report any bugs or issues, it will be appreciated :)
